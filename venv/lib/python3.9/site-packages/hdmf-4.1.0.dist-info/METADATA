========================================
The Hierarchical Data Modeling Framework
========================================

The Hierarchical Data Modeling Framework, or *HDMF*, is a Python package for working with hierarchical data.
It provides APIs for specifying data models, reading and writing data to different storage backends, and
representing data with Python objects.

Documentation of HDMF can be found at https://hdmf.readthedocs.io.
